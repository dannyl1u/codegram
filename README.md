# CodeGram

Different platforms for technical interview preparation and competitive programming, such as [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com) or [vjudge.net](https://vjudge.net) offer internal statistics on their users, but there is no unified way to view one's progress and achievements across all platforms. Further, many of those platforms lack social or competitive aspects to improving one's skills. Studies show that gamification boosts retention, meaning CodeGram will help programmers improve their skills.
