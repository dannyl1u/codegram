# CodeGram
## Problem Statement
[leetcode.com](leetcode.com) offers a great platform to gain programming skills, but there is little to none social or competitive aspects to it. Studies show that gamification boosts retention, meaning CodeGram will help programmers improve their skills.  

## Solution
CodeGram is a competitive social networking app similar to apps such as [Strava](strava.com) but with LeetCode as the activity. Users can add friends with their user id's and receive notifications if you're friends successfully complete a new problem. Other common social media components like news feeds, stories, likes/comments, and profile pages will be implemented to show scores, stats, and updates.
